## INSTADRAFT

This Python script adds every article from the [current issue of NextDraft](http://nextdraft.com/current) to your Instapaper list.

**Instructions**

1. Update the `l` and `p` auth variables. If you don't have a password (you probably don't), you can leave that one blank.

2. Use the included cron.txt file to schedule updates every afternoon. FYI, NextDraft usually comes out weekdays between 3-4pm ET.

**Why?**

Earlier this week, [I made a PHP webapp called NextPocket](http://nextpocketdraft.com) which does ads NextDraft articles to your Pocket queue. It works great for me, but a lot of folks prefer Instapaper and want a set it and forget solution. So here we are.
